# Recent Changes

## October 2, 2025 - Bot Setup and Module System Fix

**Problem:** Bot was failing to start due to module system incompatibility between CommonJS and ES modules
**Changes Made:**
1. **Environment Configuration:** Added OWNER_NUMBERS environment variable (2348180146181) to enable startup status notifications to owner's WhatsApp
2. **API Routes Migration:** Converted all 10 API route files from CommonJS to ES modules:
   - auth.js, commands.js, groups.js, health.js, messages.js
   - qr.js, settings.js, stats.js, users.js, webhooks.js
   - Changed from `module.exports` to `export default`
   - Updated imports from `require()` to `import` statements
3. **Web Server Fix:** Updated webServer.js route loading to properly handle ES module default exports
   - Fixed route import to access `.default` property for ES modules
   - Added port conflict handling with automatic fallback to alternative ports
   - Improved error handling and Promise-based server startup
4. **Status:** All 10 API routes now loading successfully, web server running on port 5000

**Current State:**
- âœ… Web server operational on port 5000
- âœ… All API endpoints accessible (/api/auth, /api/commands, /api/groups, etc.)
- âœ… Bot initialization complete
- ðŸ”„ WhatsApp connection authenticating (normal cloud startup process)
- ðŸ“± Startup notification configured to send to owner (2348180146181) once WhatsApp connects

# System Architecture

## Core Framework and WhatsApp Integration

**Problem:** Need reliable WhatsApp automation with session persistence across restarts
**Solution:** Built on @whiskeysockets/baileys v6.6.0+ with multi-format session management
**Architecture:**
- Baileys library handles WhatsApp Web protocol communication
- Session credentials stored in `cache/auth_info_baileys` directory
- Support for JSON and Base64 session formats via environment variables
- QR code generation service for initial authentication
- Automatic reconnection handling with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)

**Rationale:** Baileys provides a stable, actively maintained WhatsApp Web API wrapper. Session persistence through filesystem and environment variables enables seamless deployment across different hosting platforms.

## Command System Architecture

**Problem:** Need extensible, organized command handling with permissions and rate limiting
**Solution:** Category-based plugin architecture with dynamic loading
**Design:**
- Commands organized in folders: admin, ai, downloader, economy, fun, games, general, media, owner, utility
- Each command exports default object with name, aliases, category, execute function
- CommandHandler class manages command registration, aliases, and execution
- Built-in cooldown system prevents spam (configurable per command)
- Permission levels: owner, admin, premium, user, banned
- Rate limiting per user and command type via RateLimiter utility

**Rationale:** Modular approach allows easy addition of new commands without modifying core. Permission system ensures security. Rate limiting prevents abuse.

## Message Processing Pipeline

**Problem:** Handle various message types, quoted messages, media, and maintain context
**Solution:** MessageHandler with queue-based processing
**Flow:**
1. Raw message received from Baileys connection
2. Message content extracted (text, media, quoted context)
3. User and group data fetched/created in database
4. Anti-spam checks performed
5. Command detection (prefix-based or no-prefix in private)
6. Command execution with context injection
7. Response sent with error handling

**Rationale:** Queue-based approach prevents message loss during high load. Context injection provides commands with all necessary data (sender, group info, permissions).

## Data Persistence

**Problem:** Store user data, groups, economy, settings without requiring database in development
**Solution:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM, with graceful degradation
**Models:**
- User: jid, phone, name, ban status, economy balance, permissions
- Group: jid, name, settings (antilink, welcome), admin list
- Message: messageId, sender, content, timestamp (for logging)
- Command: usage logs for analytics

**Fallback:** When MongoDB unavailable (local dev, Replit), database operations return mock data, bot remains functional
**Rationale:** MongoDB provides flexible schema for WhatsApp data. Mongoose simplifies queries. Fallback ensures development without infrastructure dependencies.

## AI Integration

**Problem:** Provide intelligent responses using multiple AI providers
**Solution:** AIService abstraction layer
**Supported:**
- OpenAI GPT (3.5/4) via REST API
- Google Gemini via GenerativeAI SDK
- Conversation history tracking per user
- Rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion

**Implementation:** AIService maintains client instances, handles API authentication, manages conversation context in Map, implements exponential backoff for failures.

**Rationale:** Abstraction allows swapping providers. Per-user context enables coherent conversations. Rate limiting protects against cost overruns.

## Media Processing

**Problem:** Handle diverse media formats (images, videos, audio, stickers)
**Solution:** MediaHandler with FFmpeg and Canvas integration
**Capabilities:**
- Image manipulation via Canvas (filters, resize, compress)
- Video/audio conversion via FFmpeg
- Sticker creation from images/videos
- Media download from URLs
- File format validation and size limits

**Rationale:** FFmpeg provides robust media transcoding. Canvas enables image manipulation in Node. Size limits prevent memory exhaustion.

## Web Server and API

**Problem:** Provide web interface for monitoring and external integrations
**Solution:** Express.js REST API
**Endpoints:**
- `/health` - System health checks
- `/api/stats` - Bot statistics
- `/api/qr` - QR code for pairing
- `/api/commands` - Command listing
- `/api/messages` - Message sending
- `/api/users` - User management
- `/api/groups` - Group management

**Security:** JWT authentication, rate limiting (express-rate-limit), helmet for headers, CORS configured
**Rationale:** Express is lightweight and well-supported. JWT provides stateless auth. Rate limiting prevents API abuse.

## Caching Strategy

**Problem:** Reduce database queries and API calls
**Solution:** Dual-layer caching with NodeCache and optional Redis
**Architecture:**
- NodeCache for in-memory caching (default, no dependencies)
- Redis for distributed caching (optional, for multi-instance)
- Configurable TTL per cache type
- Automatic invalidation on data updates

**Rationale:** In-memory cache sufficient for single-instance. Redis enables scaling to multiple instances with shared cache.

## Error Handling and Logging

**Problem:** Track errors, debug issues, maintain application stability
**Solution:** Winston logger with multiple transports
**Features:**
- File-based logging (logs directory)
- Console output with color coding
- Log rotation to prevent disk fill
- Error tracking with counts to prevent log spam
- Separate error file for critical issues

**Process Management:** Graceful shutdown handlers for uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections
**Rationale:** Winston provides flexible logging. File persistence aids debugging production issues. Graceful shutdown prevents data loss.

## Scheduler System

**Problem:** Run periodic tasks (cleanup, backups, statistics)
**Solution:** Node-cron based TaskScheduler
**Tasks:**
- Database cleanup (old messages, expired bans)
- Session backup
- Statistics aggregation
- Cache cleanup

**Rationale:** Cron syntax familiar to developers. Event-driven approach allows dynamic task registration.

## Anti-Spam and Security

**Problem:** Prevent abuse, spam, and malicious usage
**Solution:** Multi-layered protection
**Mechanisms:**
- Message frequency tracking per user
- Pattern detection (repeated chars, caps lock, URLs)
- Automatic violation tracking with escalating penalties
- Whitelist for trusted users
- Rate limiting on commands and API

**Rationale:** Multiple detection methods catch various spam patterns. Escalating penalties discourage repeat offenders while allowing mistakes.
